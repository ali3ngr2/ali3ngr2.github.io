            <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>, is a classic way of subscribing to various feeds and websites. </h2>
            <p></p><br>

            <p>Back in the day I would use an RSS reader to subscribe to blogs, news sites, comics etc. It was great because you could customize your own reader, which would update chronologically, and set it up exactly how you liked.</p><br>

            <p>There's been a <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/blog/2020/09/rss-readers-are-coming-back-why-now-is-the-time-for-a-revival.html">push for RSS revival</a> in the past few years in the nerdiest corners of the internet, as a way to take back control of our feeds, and unshackling ourselves from the almighty data-harvesting-opinion-manipulating social media algorithm.</p>

            <p>So if you're old school like me or just waant to give it a shot, you'll first need to find a <a href="https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-rss-readers">reader</a> (I use <a href="https://www.freshrss.org/">freshRSS</a>) and add <a href="rss.xml">this feed</a> to it. Just copy paste the link and you should be good to go to get my updates through RSS.</p>
