        <p>Everyone is showing off their fake perfect life on social media. Artificial intelligence and bots are spamming blogs and message boards. Wordpress and other plateforms all use the same looking templates while UX/UI design systems have uniformed the experience we have online. Face it, the internet is dead. I long for the old, ugly, unfriendly and anonymous internet of the past. The animated flames, website counters and webrings. Bring back geocities and angelfire. I want a web of anonymous positivity. A place where everyone can share about their nerdy hobbies or create stupid cartoons. I want to see more webcomics. Violent flash animations and grainy death videos. Give me something  brutal and honest, I wanna be shocked and possibly grossed out. I want to be surprised, I want the nostalgic  feeling of exploring the web, I don’t want to have everything algorithmically curated to me. We need to destroy it in order to rebuild it. We need something wild and chaotic. When was the last time you went online and had fun?
